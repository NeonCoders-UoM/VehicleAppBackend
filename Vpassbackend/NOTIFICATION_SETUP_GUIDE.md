# Notification Backend Setup - Quick Start Guide

## 🎉 Notification System Successfully Created!

I've created a complete backend notification system for your Vehicle App that perfectly matches your Flutter frontend requirements.

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `Models/Notification.cs` - Notification entity model
- `DTOs/NotificationDTO.cs` - Data transfer object for API responses
- `DTOs/CreateNotificationDTO.cs` - DTO for creating notifications
- `DTOs/UpdateNotificationDTO.cs` - DTO for updating notifications
- `DTOs/MarkNotificationAsReadDTO.cs` - DTO for marking as read
- `Controllers/NotificationsController.cs` - Complete API controller
- `Services/NotificationService.cs` - Dedicated notification management service
- `BackgroundServices/NotificationBackgroundService.cs` - Auto-generates notifications
- `add_notifications_migration.bat` - Migration helper script
- `validate_notifications_setup.bat` - Validation script
- `test_notification_api.ps1` - API testing script
- `Examples/Notification_API_Guide.md` - Complete API documentation
- `NOTIFICATION_FINAL_STATUS.md` - Final status report

### Modified Files

- `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs` - Added Notifications DbSet and configuration
- `Program.cs` - Registered the notification service and background service
- `Examples/notifications.http` - Updated with test endpoints

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "d:\NeonCoders\VehicleAppBackend\VehicleAppBackend\Vpassbackend"

# The migration has already been created and applied!
# Your database now includes the Notifications table

# If you need to recreate the database:
dotnet ef database drop --force
dotnet ef database update
```

**✅ IMPORTANT: The cascade delete issue has been resolved!**  
We changed the Customer-Notification relationship from CASCADE to NO ACTION to prevent circular cascade paths.

### 2. Start Your Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The notification background service will start automatically and check for service reminders every 6 hours.

### 3. Validate Setup

Run the validation script to ensure everything is working:

```bash
./validate_notifications_setup.bat
```

### 4. Test the API

Option 1: Use the HTTP file

- Open `Examples/notifications.http` in VS Code and test the endpoints

Option 2: Use the PowerShell test script

```powershell
./test_notification_api.ps1
```

## 🔌 Frontend Integration

Your Flutter app should work immediately with these endpoints:

### Base URL Configuration

Update your Flutter app's base URL to point to your backend:

```dart
final String baseUrl = "https://localhost:7038"; // or your deployed URL
```

### API Endpoints Your Frontend Needs

✅ `GET /api/Notifications/Customer/{customerId}` - Get all notifications
✅ `GET /api/Notifications/Customer/{customerId}/Unread` - Get unread only  
✅ `PUT /api/Notifications/{id}/MarkAsRead` - Mark as read
✅ `PUT /api/Notifications/Customer/{customerId}/MarkAllAsRead` - Mark all as read
✅ `DELETE /api/Notifications/{id}` - Delete notification
✅ `GET /api/Notifications/Customer/{customerId}/Count` - Get counts

## 🎯 Key Features

### Automatic Notification Generation

- Service reminders automatically generate notifications when due
- Background service runs every 6 hours
- Smart duplicate prevention
- Priority-based color coding

### Frontend-Ready Data

- Matches your Flutter `NotificationModel` exactly
- Includes all display fields (vehicle info, customer name, etc.)
- Priority colors for UI styling
- Read/unread status tracking

### Comprehensive API

- Full CRUD operations
- Bulk operations (mark all as read, delete all)
- Filtering by customer and read status
- Error handling and logging

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Priority Colors

Modify in `NotificationsController.cs` around line 175:

```csharp
priorityColor = createDto.Priority.ToLower() switch
{
    "critical" => "#DC2626", // Red
    "high" => "#EA580C",     // Orange
    "medium" => "#3B82F6",   // Blue
    "low" => "#10B981",      // Green
    _ => "#3B82F6"           // Default
};
```

### Background Service Frequency

Modify in `NotificationBackgroundService.cs` line 13:

```csharp
private readonly TimeSpan _period = TimeSpan.FromHours(6); // Change frequency here
```

### Notification Templates

Add custom message templates in the background service around line 60.

## 📱 Testing with Your Flutter App

1. Start your backend server
2. Update your Flutter app's API base URL
3. Test the notification flow:
   - Create some service reminders
   - Run: `POST /api/Notifications/GenerateFromServiceReminders`
   - Check your Flutter app's notifications page

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Errors**: Ensure you're in the correct directory with the `.csproj` file
2. **CORS Issues**: The backend is configured for development with permissive CORS
3. **Database Connection**: Check your `appsettings.json` connection string

### Logs

The application logs all notification operations. Check the console output for:

- Notification creation/deletion events
- Background service execution
- API request errors

## 📚 Documentation

See `Examples/Notification_API_Guide.md` for complete API documentation including:

- All endpoint details
- Request/response examples
- Frontend integration guides
- Database schema
- Error handling

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your notification backend is ready! The system will:

- ✅ Automatically generate notifications from service reminders
- ✅ Provide all the APIs your Flutter frontend needs
- ✅ Handle read/unread status and deletion
- ✅ Include proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Scale with your application as it grows

Happy coding! 🚀
